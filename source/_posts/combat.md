When it comes to line of sight, sometimes you have to use your best judgment.

![Line Of Sight](./combat/los.PNG)

The image above shows the avalible targets a unit has if its standing in the YELLOW hex on the map.

The blackened out areas are "walls" or Enemy units and you cannot target units behind them.

The BLUE highlited hex on the map are untargetable units.		

The WHITE Hex are targetable hexes by drawing a straight line From the CENTER of the YELLOW hex to the CENTER of the targeted hex.

![Line Of Sight](./combat/los2.PNG)

In this image, lines are drawn from the center of one hex, to the center of another.	

If the line comes in contact with a Wall or an enemy unit before the target hex, the unit cannont be targeted. 	

If the line doesnt come in contact with a wall or an enemy unit before the target hex, the target is legal.
