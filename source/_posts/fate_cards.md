There are two main types of Fate Cards

#### Crystals

#### Blessings

![CRITICAL Fate Card is used to give a unit extra DMG on Successful Attack Actions a Unit may take.](./fate_cards/CRITICAL.jpg)

The CRITICAL Fate Card can only be used on a Unit before you use any Actions or Movement for that Unit.


Blessings allow the player to perform a powerful action each turn, while Crystals are resources for Blessings Units and Equipment to take advantage of.


> The most powerful of all the Fate Cards is the SOUL Fate Card.

![SOUL Fate Card allows you to revive a fallen Unit that has been destroyed and not condemned back to your start zone, its equipment will remain with that Unit](./fate_cards/SOUL.jpg)


The SOUL Fate Card has two options on how to play it. It can either be used to revive a fallen unit, or, if you have four CRYSTAL Fate cards, can be used to summon The Shattering to your start zone to aid you in battle.

The Shatting is a strong Unit and is capable of ending the game quickly. But waiting to collect all those CRYSTAL Fate Cards could make you fall behind the competition.
